# NFT Minting Simulation
This project simulates the process of minting NFTs using JavaScript. Each NFT represents a unique digital book with associated metadata.

**Minting NFTs:**

The mintNFT function creates a new NFT with given metadata, including book name, author, description, and link to purchase.
Each NFT is assigned a unique ID and added to the collection.

**Listing NFTs:**

The listNFTs function prints the details of all NFTs in the collection.
It displays the ID, book name, author, description, and purchase link for each NFT.
